Just messing around to show off Git and GitHub

## I'd like to do some simple formatting

Here is some **bold** text

Here is some *italics*

Here is some ***bold italics***  

So if you are typing and it's important to have the name of your favorite gene, *binK*, in italics, it really doesn't break up your flow to just add a few asterisks.

If you're writing a paper in markdown, keep in mind that git tracks each line separately.
Therefore, it's useful to write each sentence on a separate line.
Don't worry, when they render they will look like one paragraph.

## I'd like to do some fancier formatting!!

### Tables, please!

Strain  | Antibiotic resistance
--------|----------------------
MJM1100 | None
MJM1198 | chloramphenicol

Table alignment using colons:

Strain  | Antibiotic resistance
-------:|---------------------:
MJM1100 | None
MJM1198 | chloramphenicol

Strain  | Antibiotic resistance
:-------|:---------------------
MJM1100 | None
MJM1198 | chloramphenicol

Strain  | Antibiotic resistance
:------:|:--------------------:
MJM1100 | None
MJM1198 | chloramphenicol

### superscripts & subscripts

H<sub>2</sub>O

E = mc<sup>2</sup>

H2O

### links

We just built a sweet page in this repo. It's called [newbie](newbie.md).

Compare that nice formatting to this awful HTML: <A HREF="newbie.md">newbie</A>
